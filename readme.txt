A small plugin that allows one to change the logo, link and link description on the log-in page of WordPress

== Description ==

This plugin allows one to upload an image and replace the default one displayed on the WordPress log-in page.
The plugin uses jQuery to replace the CSS on the log-in page. The link "name" and "description" are changed using
two of the WordPress provided hooks.

== Installation ==

Option #1:

1. Upload files to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory (preserve sub-directory structure if applicable)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Refer to the official plugin page for documentation, usage and tips

Option #2:

Use the new built-in WordPress interface. Access the Plugins submenu and select "Add New". From there you
should be able to either upload the .zip file downloaded from the WordPress repository or search the repository
itself. If you choose to search the repository enter "Logo candy" and on top of the list WP prints should be this
plug-in. Refer to the WrodPress documentation on how to use the new plugin installation system. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What image should I use? =

You can use any image you like. For optimal results though, you should use an image with width 326 pixels.
The height of the image is not that relevant as long as you stay within sane values. Just for reference the default
WP 2.7.1 image is 310x70 pixels.
